DelphiStyleBookmarks
====================

Delphi style bookmarks for Sublime Text Editor. 

___
Hotkeys:<br>
<i>Ctrl+Shift+[1..9]</i> - set a bookmark<br>
<i>Ctrl+[1..9]</i> - jump to bookmark 
___

Originally Delphi bookmarks are displayed as icons with numbers over them, unfortunatelly API of STE doesn't allow to assign custom icons to bookmark. It is only possible to assign four different pictures. There is nothing to do but wait for API extension, or if you know the way how do that you are welcome to contribute.
___
Please pay attention that hotkey <i>Ctrl+Shift+[1..9]</i> interrupts standard functionality to move focused file between panels in multiple column layout. You can set up your own hotkeys if that is important for you.
